### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

#### What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?

#### How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?

- Reach mutual agreement on decisions.
- Make sure that everyone is included in decision making process.

This will be accomplished via the following:

- Check-in with group before making a major decision or at least put it in Slack.

Ryan

- No restraints. Not a morning person, prefer 9:00a at the earliest.

Chris

- No restraints. I have no life and I will work on code all day. I like going to sleep at 10:00p.

#### What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?

All

- Direct, honest, respectful.

#### What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?

Greg

- Strength: iterator methods. Can always get things working.
- Improvement: planning classes, architecture. Making smaller commits.

Ryan

- Strength: manipulating data with array prototypes. Decently strong with SOLID and SRP. Refactoring.
- Improvement: scope. Sometimes need to use a console.log to figure things out. Learn more about MVC and separation of concerns. Testing. Less repetitive tests.

Chris

- Strength: prototype methods, data manipulation, web api methods, problem solving.
- Improvement: testing, git workflow in a group, code organization, writing expressive code that isn't too complicated and that is easily understood.

---

#### How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?

Surface the issue ASAP and discuss it. Work to identify next steps. Ask for help if you need it. Don't stay stuck for more than 30 minutes.

- Meet MVP.
- Ensure we all learned something and understand how the project functions.
- Developed repeatable good habits that can translate to future projects.
- Identify pain points or issues that need work for next time.

Greg

- Get some extensions done.
- Clean, well-commented code.

Ryan

- Drag and drop on touch devices.
- UI that looks professional and that has an appropriate color palette.

Chris

- Get drag and drop to work. I want to learn this.
- Get better at testing complicated code.

---

#### How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?

- Call it out if you see something. Let members know they are appreciated. Celebrate every success. Share what you've learned with the intent of educating others.
